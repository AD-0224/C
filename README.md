C Language Exercises and Mini-Projects

This repository contains my exercises, examples, and projects developed during my journey learning the C programming language.
I focus on core concepts such as string manipulation (strlen, strcpy, strcmp), pointers, loops, conditionals, sorting algorithms, structures, and practical projects like a calculator.

My goal is to progress step-by-step, share useful resources for beginners, and build a solid portfolio for my freelance career.

After attending the 42 school, I am now dedicated to self-learning and sharing my journey through an ebook and online resources.
